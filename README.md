# PolkaDotGameCpp
![demo](./demo.gif)

This is a clone of a game called Polka Dot Game adapted from the Circle Game by Shea Barton

[Check the original game](https://www.polkadotgame.com/)

## How to play the game

Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Magoninho/PolkaDotGameCpp.git
```
Go to the directory
```
cd PolkaDotGameCpp
```
Now type the command to run the game (linux):
```
Release/PolkaDotGame
```

If you're on windows, I'm sorry lol, but I'll try to use cmake later...
